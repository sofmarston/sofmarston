Beaches provide habitat, enterainment and much more. People enjoy beaches for its water, the sand, and the beautiful views it has to offer. Animals appreciate the beaches because it provides them a place to live. Beaches are a significant element of the enviornment. If we don't work hard to keep beaches clean, people will not be able to enjoy them and it will cause harm to a lot of echosystems and animals that rely on it. </p>
<p> This company works to promote beach cleanup as a commmunity service opportunity or as serious as it becoming people's careers. This company was established in 2000 and has sucessfully continued ever since. The founder of this company is Elizabeth Norman and myself. We created this company because we both became very passionate about keeping the beaches around us clean as we grew up and wanted to make a sustainable company out of it as we got older. The company has grown tremedously over the last 20 years and we have high hopes of nothing less for the years to come! </p>
<p> Currently, the company's primary goal is focused on the increased involvement of participation. This means we are working on marketing, spreading awareness, traveling to talk to communities, hosting events and much more. We want the population to understand that we all have a responsiblity to take care of the beaches we use in order for other species to continue to thrive. What we have provided in the past in terms of what attracts supporters includes sightseeing. We started this company by providing people with the ability to visit beautiful beaches but also visiting what beaches can turn into if they are not taken care of. We believe that these views of different beaches is what gives people the realization of how important beaches are. </p>
<hr>
<p>Now, some of you might be wondering how being involved in this company can really make an impactful environmental difference. We would love to explain why we need people who care about the environment, especially our beaches, just as much as us. There are not many companies that are similar to ours in the way that we provide opportunities for people to have full time, part time, and volunteering jobs here along with people exploring our beaches and letting our company educate them. There are no other businesses that provide the unique experience of being hands-on while also being able to train for things like educational events and becoming one of our traveling speakers. Educating the world is a goal we are very dedicated to as well as respecting the beaches so it is important to acquire people that want these experiences. Our employee environment is at the top of our priority as we want everyone that has shown interest to be respected and we want to show our gratitude for you. The experiences people have being involved in this company is like nothing else. It is a wonderful way to give back to the environment that has provided so much for us. </p>
