	<h2>Learn more about our products we have to offer! </h2>

<p> 
The company has three primary services we offer to the people that want to make a difference. The first service is to travel with a small group to different locations to clean different beaches and learn about the history and type of community that surrounds the land. We love this service because it offers people the chance to travel, connect to this environmental issue on a more personal level, while also doing the amazing community service that is needed. 
The second service we provide is local beach cleanups. We provide a schedule that customers can pick from, with a smaller group (not too overwhelming) and they still get to be educated about the beaches. This is a similar opportunity for people that aren't as willing to travel. 
And lastly, our third service is to participate in volunteer opportunities within the company. This includes supervising a younger group clean up or becoming a guest speaker, etc. These services, we feel, give our people the chance to choose and explore what they are most interested in. 
Additionally, feel free to check out these websites below that give more information about the importance of keeping the beaches around you clean! https://www.wavetribe.com/blogs/eco/why-beach-cleanups-are-important and https://blog.sandos.com/en/why-its-so-important-to-keep-our-beaches-clean/
