<h2>Our policies that makes our company stronger!</h2>
<p> 
	This is a list of our financial policies 
</p>
<ul> 
	<li> travel and expense reimbursement</li>
	<li> investment tracking</li>
	<li> donating tracking</li>
	<li> fund balance and reserves </li>
</ul>
<p> 
As for our delivery policies, we do not consider any of our programs delivery based unless there is an event where we are spreading awareness by traveling to communities delivering gifts. Our company is based on traveling to where the environment needs our help, all volunteers and employees are committed to traveling with us so there truthfully is not a delivery policy. All of the travel packs are picked up at our location before volunteers or employees go out to specific beaches.   
</p>

<p> 
In relation to our store return policy, we do not consider ourselves a store, we are rather a community that seeks help from the public. However, if a volunteer or employee decides to purchase one of our travel packs in advance to pick up and something happens to come up to which they are not available to contribute anymore, we are able to provide a 12-hour advanced cancellation which is completely free. However, if any shorter of a notice, there is a small $5.00 fee to pay.
